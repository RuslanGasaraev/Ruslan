When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love

Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
Love, love
When the garden flowers, baby are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red

Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
